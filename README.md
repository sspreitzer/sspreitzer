### Hi there üëã

At Aveniq I am leading the continous integration and delivery of a Kubernetes platform product, that is infrastructure agnostic and in line with the Cloud Native Computing Foundation project portfolio. My customers benefit from a highly scalable, secure, self-service and self-healing cloud native application platform, that is on-premise or in the public cloud, but with the same set of features and expectations.

In the last years I successfully moved Swiss SME companies from legacy compute platforms to scalable container clusters, enabling their business to scale, innovate and grow. A main focus is security, namely container images at rest, containers at runtime, data in transit and data at rest.

Besides IT, I am training people to become scuba divers. My students have achieved a variety of scuba diving certifications and specialties.

Besides IT and scuba diving I am studying management sciences and have achieved a variety of diplomas. Namely an MBA in IT-Management, and CASs in General Management, IT-Management, Digital Strategy & Performance, Innovative & New Leadership. My current focus is to finish an EMBA thesis about "Quiet Quitting". I am working towards a Ph.D., the Doctor of Business Administration.

I combine decades of in-depth IT technology experience and knowledge with an extensive knowledge of the organization of passionate and performing human work.
