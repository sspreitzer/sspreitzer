### Hi there 👋

At SIX Group I am leading an international agile product team of Kubernetes technology experts. Together, we operate, maintain, and continuously improve an efficient, secure and stable container platform that underpins core financial infrastructure services for Spain and Switzerland, including exchanges, securities, financial information, and banking solutions.

After work I am training people to become scuba divers. My students have achieved a variety of scuba diving certifications and specialties.

Besides work and scuba diving I am studying management sciences and have achieved a variety of diplomas. Namely an EMBA in Innovative & New Leadership, an MBA in IT-Management, CASs in General Management, IT-Management, Digital Strategy & Performance, Innovative & New Leadership. I am currently a student of the Doctor of Business Administration.

I uniquely combine decades of in-depth Information Technology experience and education with an extensive knowledge of the organization of passionate and performing human work.
